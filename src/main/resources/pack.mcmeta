Note that with pack_format 3 and 4, all of the file names in the resource pack should have lowercase letters only (eg: en_us.lang).  A pack_format of 1 is needed in Java Edition 1.6, 1.7, and 1.8.  A pack_format of 2 is needed in Java Edition 1.9 and 1.10.  Note that a pack_format of 2 will load your mod resources with LegacyV2Adapter, which requires language files to have uppercase letters (eg: en_US.lang)."
